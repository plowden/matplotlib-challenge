Three observable trends from the data:

1. Capomulin shrinks tumors significantly whereas Infubinol, Ketapril, and the placebo don't halt the growth of the tumor.

2. Capomulin also inhibits matastasis significantly better than the other three.

3. Probably due to the above, Capomulin also has a much higher survival rate than the other three.

In sum, I'm putting my mouse on Capomulin.
